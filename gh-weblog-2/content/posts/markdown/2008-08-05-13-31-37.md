# Lightroom and Photoshop colors

For those of you who are wondering why images look different between Lightroom and Photoshop (too red in Lightroom or too dead in Photoshop), set up your color management:

In Photoshop, set up [view] -> [proof setup] -> [windows RGB]

When telling Lightroom to edit a photograph in Photoshop, click 'copy with lightroom adjustments' (seriously, why would you want either of the other two options?) and when Photoshop prompts you about an embedded profile mismatch, choose "convert to the working space".

This is all you have to do for Photoshop and Lightroom to play nice in terms of Photoshop showing you exactly what you wanted to see based on what you were doing in Lightroom.
