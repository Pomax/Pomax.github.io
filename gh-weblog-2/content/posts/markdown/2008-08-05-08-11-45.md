# I made this!

I hate the 'I made this!' kid from the Gracie end-of-simpsons production house notice so very much... as well as the people who thought that was a good production house notice for on a guaranteed long running show.

Anyway. <a href="http://www.nihongoresources.com" target="_blank">nihongoresources</a> is my website for students and would-be students of Japanese. You could be following courses in it at a college or university, studying it at home for fun, or thinking about learning Japanese: this site is for you. It has dictionaries, including sound effect and particle dictioanries, a free grammar book (of close to 300 pages) and free lessons at university level for those who are serious about learning.
