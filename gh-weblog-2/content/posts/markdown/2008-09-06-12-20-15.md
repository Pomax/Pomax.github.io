# View Source Chart

I found <a href="http://jennifermadden.com/scripts/ViewRenderedSource.html" target="_blank">view source chart</a> an indispensable plugin for firefox. While I could spend another 2 weeks writing my own version of it, but I figured Jennifer deserved the $10 she charges for it.

I mean, seriously... it's only $10. That's what, not even 2 coffees at a Starbucks? And their coffee isn't even tasty anymore, it just tastes burnt, rather than roasted.
