# What's it actually do?

First off, the header. The header is a cropped version of the "larger version" of the latest image that got added to my (but potentially anyone's) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> account. It uses <a href="http://www.php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> with the <a href="http://code.iamcal.com/php/flickr/readme.htm" target="_blank">PEAR::Flickr-API</a> package to get a fix on the data required to build the URL for the image, then loads that URL into the <a href="http://www.libgd.org" target="_blank">GD</a> package (comes compiled into PHP 5), which builds a jpg object off of it, crops it, and then sends that on as actual jpg file data. This is then used as background image for the header div, which is wrapped in an anchor to the Flickr page for that image. Which is nifty.
