# Digital Photography

I love my digital SLR (I have a nikon d200), but I never understood why digital cameras pretend that digital optical receptors are just 'the digital equivalence of film'. They're not, they are completely different and could be made to do so much more than traditional film every could have. to this effect one of my projects is to write a small paper on a new way to treat the digital optical receptor and get some fundamentally new ways of taking photographs off the ground. Hopefully.
