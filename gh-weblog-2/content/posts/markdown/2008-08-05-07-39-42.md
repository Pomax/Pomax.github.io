# Nihongoresources

My baby, as it were, except I would be a rather negligent parent if I considered it that. Nihongo resources is the website I run for Japanese education material - online dictionaries and lessons, and a downloadable book on the grammar of Japanese are available, and I hope to, over the coming two years, drastically increase the volume of content as well as its footprint on the internet.
