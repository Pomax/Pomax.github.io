I love Mahjong. The real game, with four players, not the solitaire version. I like it enough to have written a classical Chinese rules scoring webpage, so that whenever we play we can keep score easily (classical Chinese rules are complicated, and everyone has to settle scores amongst everyone else, so a computerised approach is far nicer than having to do everything by hand...) - If you're in the neighbourhood and feel like a game of Chinese classical, drop a line =)
