# Coffee grinder

You no doubt know of the spinny blady coffee grinders you can buy. I own one, and there are two major problems with it. 1) it gets quite warm while it's grinding, and 2) it doesn't grind. It punches the beans in the face until they explode in small fragments, which it then proceeds to punch in the face too. This doesn't lead to the most uniform grind. The following is my idea of a good coffee grinder: dual stone wheel on a variable height spring, which crushes by virtue of rolling over the beans at a height that the bean cannot accommodate. Slowly decreasing height means low-friction crushing, which means the coffee doesn't change flavour. The design would be reasonably simple too, I shall try to sketch it out in <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/" target="_blank">SketchUp</a> soon and put the image link up for illustration.
