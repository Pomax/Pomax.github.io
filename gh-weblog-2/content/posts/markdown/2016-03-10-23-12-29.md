Ever drawn some paths in Photoshop, and wanted to export those paths for use in other, probably not-Adobe, products? Because that's kind of ... impossible.

Or, it was, now it isn't, because I needed this functionality and happened to know that Photoshop has a Javascript API. Well... sort of. It has an API for a truly *ancient* version of Javascript (an almost 20 year old flavour, in fact), so there were some things that needing some shimming. Basic things like `Array.forEach` didn't exist 20 years ago so after writing shims for `forEach`, `map` and `Object.keys`, I was able to write a script that lets you simply call *file* → *scripts* → *browse* and then run it, which immediately generates the SVG code for all your paths as a single SVG document and copies the code for it into your clipboard.

Done, as the say. Head on over to https://github.com/Pomax/photoshop-paths-to-SVG to grab the script and let me know if you find it useful or have ideas on how to improve it.
