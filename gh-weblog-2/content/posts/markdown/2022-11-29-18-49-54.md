Don't worry, we're not putting JS inside actual aeroplanes... that would probably kill people.

Instead, we're implementing an "level and altitude hold" autopilot in JS to control a little virtual aeroplane. And by "little" I actually mean "any aeroplane in [Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020]" because as it turns out, MSFS comes with an API that can be used to both query _and set_ values relating from anything as simple as the current airspeed to something as complex as spawning a fleet of aircraft and making them perform formation flights while making their smoke pattern spell out the works of Chaucer.

So we're not doing that (today), instead we're going to add an autopilot for planes that don't have one, like my favourite real-life plane, the DeHavilland DHC-2 "Beaver", originally made by DeHavilland but these days made by Viking Air. Specifically, the float plane version, which flies between Vancouver and Eastern [Vancouver Island](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2249770) and locations dotted around the [Strait of Georgia](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/13321885)). I don't have a pilot's license, but I love sitting in the copilot seat and flying over beautiful British Columbia at only 1000 feet.

But back to JS: MSFS comes with the [SimConnect SDK](https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/Programming_Tools/SimConnect/SimConnect_SDK.htm) which lets people write addons in C, C++, or languages with .NET support, and so of course folks have written connectors that just "proxy" the SimConnect calls and return values to things like Go, Node, Python etc. So of course, the first thought is "cool, find the node-simconnect package and let's goooo" except no, because the node-simconnect package is kind of incomplete, so instead we reach for the next best thing: [python-simconnect](https://pypi.org/project/SimConnect/).

Using python-simconnect, we can write a tiny Python webserver with `GET` calls for querying MSFS, and `POST` calls for setting values in-sim. Although it turns out that even python-simconnect is incomplete, so we're actually using [a fork I made](https://github.com/Pomax/Python-SimConnect/tree/edits) that makes some improvements we need to in order to tell all the different states that MSFS can be in apart. And then we can write some good old static HTML that uses [the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to talk to the Python server for all its needs.

And with that, let's write an autopilot!

...

But first, let's write something simpler, so we know what we're doing.
