# We have comments

After a day of listening to the <a href='http://www.penny-arcade.com/padlc.xml' target='_blank'>podcasts</a> of <a href='http://www.penny-arcade.com' target='_blank'>Penny Arcade</a> and doing some coding, the commenting system is a go. I had to make sure that entries and full sections have 'allow commenting' so that I can post stuff like my CV without you lot being able to comment on it (seriously, don't want to =).

I also had to battle my laptop a little because for some reason for the longest time <a href='http://www.php.net/' target='_blank'>PHP</a> croaked on the flickr code. After installing <a href='http://pear.php.net/' target='_blank'>PEAR</a>, things went tits-up and I think I spent a good hour trying to figure out why my local copy yielded a blanco page right after the header information was issued to the browser. It was all very curious...

Anyway, comments are a go, now to hope people actually visit =P
