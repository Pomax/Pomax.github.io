# Escape your strings...

Never send data with a javascript POST call without rewriting your string... most specifically, use this:

ã€€ã€€var data = document.getElementById('someid').value;<br/>
ã€€ã€€data = data.replace("%","%<b></b>25");<br/>
ã€€ã€€data = data.replace("&","%<b></b>26");

This gave me headaches for quite a while, and blaming half a dozen things that had absolutely nothing to do with it >.>
