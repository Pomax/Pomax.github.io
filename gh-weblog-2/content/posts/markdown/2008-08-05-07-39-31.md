# TRT-NL

I am currently working for Thales Research and Technology in Delft, the Netherlands, under a 2 year contract. The idea is to work for two years as a software engineer there, while my immigration to Canada gets processed. Since this is not the speediest of processes, a full-time limited duration contract seemed like a good idea. At Thales, I am currently working on cleaning up and extending a software architecture that I also worked on for my graduation project (for a M.Sc. in the field of A.I.). I do this job four days in the week, so that I have more than just the weekend left to work on other projects.
