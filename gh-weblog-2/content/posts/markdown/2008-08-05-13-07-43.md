# Commenting system

The one thing I have still to do is add in a commenting system. Not that I expect my website to become some kind of forum of intelligent interchange (what is this, IRC? ... oh wait) but it's something I'd like to have done anyway. You know, the whole "get some experience with". Sure, it's not too complex, but then I can at least say I have experience building a simple personal homepage CMS with web log capabilities. Always nice.
