# It's a mode of thinking, really.

I won't lie - I like to create stuff, and programming things is creating things. I mostly code for things that end up on the web (such as <a href="http://www.nihongoresources.com" target="_blank">nihongoresources</a> projects) but I also program things for fun just to see if I can. I program mainly in <a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net" target="_blank">PHP</a>, though I imagine this might be extended with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336809.aspx" target="_blank">C#</a> in the nearby future given the job I now have.
