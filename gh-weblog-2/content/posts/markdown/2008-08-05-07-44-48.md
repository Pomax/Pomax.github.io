# Folding bike

Modern folding bikes annoy me. They have small wheels, and they look ugly. What if you made a normal mountain bike, with a frame of interlocking pipes held together by the tension of metal wire running through the inside of the pipes? I can hear you think "Why, that sounds almost like modern tent frames..." and yeah, that's pretty much what I was thinking of too. Although in my idea, the fact that if there is no tension there is no bike means you can actually have a bike with a key that can lock the tensor in place. No key? Can't use the bike because it's just a jumble of pipes. Weld the pipes? Clearly you now have an illegal bike..
