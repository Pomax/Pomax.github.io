HDMI cables are not all created equal.

That sounds obvious, but it's a problem most people won't really run into. If you just need to connect your TV to your bluray player or your game console, almost any HDMI cable will work for you. Get a length that you need, maybe pay a little more to ensure that it's a 18Gbps cable for maximum bandwidth, and done.

Things are not so simple when you do videography, though. I have a UHD video source, which sends data at 10 bit, 4:2:2 4k video, at 60 frames per second, to a UHD recorder monitor. That signal has to be perfect: if it's not, frames get dropped and the recorder goes into black screen mode.
