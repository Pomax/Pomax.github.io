# What's it actually do? - part 2

The second part to the site is the posting system. All the entries are stored in a <a href="http://sqlite.org/"  target="_blank">SQLite</a> database file, which PHP can 'natively' read because it's come with SQLite interfacing for a while now (although it does not come with 3.x support compiled in by default, and officially SQLite has dropped 2.x support) - The entire content system is an online input deal. I can add, update and remove sections, and add posts to any section, as well as update or delete posts. I simply load up the admin page, and javascript and php play nice together, javascript making sure I get to see the section structure and the list of posts per section, and PHP being invoked by java to do all the adding, modifying and deleting. It's quite lovely really.
