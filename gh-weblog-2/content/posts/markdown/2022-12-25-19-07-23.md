Python does not have syntax for writing C structs, or things that act like them, but thankfully you can write a class decorator that adds something that feels like it should have been in the language from day one.

```
def as_struct(struct_class):
	# create a new init
	def struct_init(self, *args):
		i = 0 # we really don't need enumerate here...
		for value in list(args):
			name = field_names[i]
			default_value = field_values[i]
			setattr(self, name, value if value is not None else default_value)
			i += 1 # ...we just need to inc an int
	# extract the struct fields
	field_names = []
	field_values = []
	for attr_name in dir(struct_class):
		if not attr_name.startswith('_'):
			value = getattr(struct_class, attr_name)
			if not callable(value):
				field_names.append(attr_name)
				field_values.append(value)
	# rebind and return
	struct_class.__init__ = struct_init
	return struct_class
```

With this, we can write code with nice Struct-likes:

```
from as_struct import as_struct

@as_struct
class Orientation():
    pitch = 0
    roll = 0
    yaw = 0

@as_struct
class Trim():
    elevator = 0
    aileron = 0
    rudder = 0

class Brrrrrr():
    def __init__(self):
        self.description = "I'm a plane!"
        self.orientation = Orientation()
        self.trim = Trim()

    def trim(self, e=0, a=0, r=0):
        self.trim.elevator += e
        self.trim.aileron += a
        self.trim.rudder += r
```

Done.
