Python does not have syntax for writing C structs, or things that act like them, but thankfully you can write a class decorator that adds something that feels like it should have been in the language from day one.

```
def struct(struct_class):
    # create a new init
    def struct_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
        i = 0 # we really don't need enumerate() here...
        for value in args:
            name = member_names[i]
            default_value = member_values[i]
            setattr(self, name, value if value is not None else default_value)
            i += 1 # ...we just need to inc an int
        for key,value in kwargs.items():
            i = member_names.index(key)
            default_value = member_values[i]
            setattr(self, key, value if value is not None else default_value)
    # extract the struct members
    member_names = []
    member_values = []
    for attr_name in dir(struct_class):
        if not attr_name.startswith('_'):
            value = getattr(struct_class, attr_name)
            if not callable(value):
                member_names.append(attr_name)
                member_values.append(value)
    # rebind and return
    struct_class.init = struct_init
    return struct_class
```

With this, we can write code with nice Struct-likes:

```
from as_struct import as_struct

@as_struct
class Orientation():
    pitch = 0
    roll = 0
    yaw = 0

@as_struct
class Trim():
    elevator = 0
    aileron = 0
    rudder = 0

class Brrrrrr():
    def __init__(self):
        self.description = "I'm a plane!"
        self.orientation = Orientation()
        self.trim = Trim()

    def trim(self, e=0, a=0, r=0):
        self.trim.elevator += e
        self.trim.aileron += a
        self.trim.rudder += r
```

Done.
