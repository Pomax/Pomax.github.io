Ever had your external SSD refuse to remount when you plug it into MacOS because it's an idiotic OS and remembers you didn't properly ejected it?

First, kill `fsck` because it's ruining the party right now:

```
$ ps aux | grep fsck
```
find the process id and `sudo kill -9 thatid` because goddamnit, fsck, stop ruining the party. Then, simply remount your drive:

```
$ diskutils mount /Volumes/disk3s2
```

Or whatever your disk volume is according to Disk Utility.
