# Mahjong

I'm in the process of writing an AI mahjong playing algorithm. The idea is that once that works, it's essentially trivial to plug it into a "play a game of MJ" program, and get people to buy it. I love mahjong, and I need to make a bit more money. Why not combine the two in a way to is less certain to make me lose money at a table ;)
