# First Post!

Okay, not really first. There are three posts that for historical purposes (they are the remnants of the test phase, but they highlight why it needed a test phase to begin with =).

Given the ease with which I can now make posts, I shall probably be making posts whenever something related to my projects comes up, or when an idea hits that seems like it deserves a slightly better treatment than to be forgotten after a few days because I couldn't do anything concrete with it.
