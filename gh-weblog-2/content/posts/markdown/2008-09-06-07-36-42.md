# What's it actually do? - part 3

In addition to all the previously mentioned things, the nav menus might be of interest. They use a "navmenu" element, rather than having you define all the divs, and get javascript rewritten to right-hand-side menus floating against the blog content. The styling, of course, is variable because it's just CSS, and uses four divs. the main div is the container for all menu boxes. Each box then has a navtitle, navcontent and navfoot section in it. In this case, the title and footer are blue backgrounded, and the content has inherited white background with blue borders.
