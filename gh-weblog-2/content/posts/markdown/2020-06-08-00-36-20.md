If you're reading this, you probably know my [Primer on BÃ©zier Curves](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/), but what you probably don't know is that until today this build process for this was entirely manual. A code change would require landing the code, then checking out `master`, running `npm run build`, then pushing the rebuilt files back up to `master`, and then doing the same for the `bezierinfo` repo, which exists in parallel.

Most of that work has now been automated with [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Whenever content or build related files get updated on the master branch, Github will now cause [ci.yml](https://github.com/Pomax/BezierInfo-2/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml) to kick in, which runs through the following steps:

1. check out `master`
2. Install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive), which installs all the TeX features that the primer relies on
3. Pulls the `pdf2svg` source code from the web and builds it
4. Grabs [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and uses it to install the latest version of Node and runs `npm install`
5. Runs `npm run build`
6. Commits and pushes the result back up to `master`

So the only thing I still need to do manually now is sync from the `BezierInfo-2` dev repo to the main `bezierinfo` repo, which feels sensible: you don't want to indiscriminately push your dev code to prod without review.

But this sure makes an involved process a heck of a lot easier.
