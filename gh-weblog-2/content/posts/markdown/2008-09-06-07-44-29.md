# Universal Lens Mount

I have a Nikon digital SLR. I also have a stack of old Canon lenses. I cannot use these two together and this annoys me a hell of a lot. Now, the only way to get these two to "talk" to each other would be to slot some kind of adapter ring between the two and then you have the problem that the lens' focal plain is somewhere in front of the camera's image plane. You'd need to move the image plane down from "inside the adapter" to "where it is supposed to be". So... why hasn't anyone made this yet? I figured it would make sense to use something like an adapter with interchangable mountings at either end (camera mount and lens mount), and a variable lens system in the actual adapter ring to move the image plane up and down. No one's made this. I would certainly buy one if someone did.

The idea is simple. Slot two adapters to the back and front, and the center bit is a liquid correction lens. viscous fluid on the front and back of a glass plate, with optical plastic lenses containing it, which can "bulge" to correct for divergence/convergence so that the image plane can be projected onto the real image plane.
