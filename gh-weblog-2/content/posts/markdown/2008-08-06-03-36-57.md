# Automatic file attachments

One other thing I also need to add, so I don't have to worry about putting things in directories myself, and then where, is a file upload system so I can upload images, pdf files, etc. so I can simply quicklink to them in posts. Shouldn't be too hard.. a structured repository dir with a database to track which file goes where should be good enough.
