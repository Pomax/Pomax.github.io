Let me preface this by saying that every single person who thinks that mingw or msys are valid excuses for not targeting true windows is actively making life worse for large swathes of developers. You're not helping. Windows applications and libraries should work on Windows, using the Windows platform.

With that out of the way, let's write some code in Rust that we can call from Node.js so that we get the best of both worlds: the ease of development of Node.js, with the "I need this to be fast" parts handled by natively compiled code.

- install LLVM because you'll need LLD
- create a `C:\Users\yournamehere\.cargo\config` file and add the following code to it:

```
[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
linker = "lld-link.exe"
```
