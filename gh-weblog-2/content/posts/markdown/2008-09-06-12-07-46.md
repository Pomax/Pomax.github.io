# dynamically loading javascript

While writing the code for this homepage, I ran into the annoying problem that you cannot load javascript into the javascript stack after a page has finished loading. This means that using javascript to load something through an xmlhttprequest that happens to have a "script" element in it, is going to just sit there in the DOM tree without actually being loaded into the javascript stack.

Turns out there is a magical way to get it added anyway: relocate any and all script elements into the head element! Any changes to the head are processed regardless of when it happens.

This might, however, require you to do something like:
<blockquote>
var script = document.createElement("script");<br/>
script.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");<br/>
script.setAttribute("src", "thejsyouwantedtoload.js");<br/>
document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);
