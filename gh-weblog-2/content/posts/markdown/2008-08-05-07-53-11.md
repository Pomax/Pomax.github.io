# The perfect shot

I own a <a href="http://www.nikon.ca/en/product.aspx?m=17002" target="_blank">Nikon D200</a> and like to exercise that ownership by taking photographs of things that I like to take photographs of. I typically select the 'good' shots from these exercises and put them on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com" target="_blank">Flickr</a> account, which can be found at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pomax" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pomax</a>. That page is also far more informative than I could be in this blurb! For a small sampling, look at the header for this page: that's a crop of my most recently posted photograph.
