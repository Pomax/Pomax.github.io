# Nanoose Bay

I'm working through my backlog of photographs (1650 for 2008 so far... This is going to take a while O.o). Of course, the vast majority are not of a quality that I consider online-publishable (let alone publishable in other media) but it's still a considerable backlog to work through. For the moment I've put some pictures up from when I went to Nanoose Bay with Arty-chan and her mom in March 2008. Click on the header to be transported to my <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/pomax' target='_blank'>Flickr</a> account to see all of them =)
