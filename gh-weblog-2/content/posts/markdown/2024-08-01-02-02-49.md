Did you know that there isn't just a dumb, simple Windows utility for turning a joystick or game controller into a MIDI device? Sure. you can find 15 year old utilities (that have no docs, so good luck figuring out why they don't work even if they _run), and yes, you can find some dedicated "profile" utils that map specific game controller buttons to specific MIDI outs, but like... I have [VKB-Sim rudder pedals](https://www.vkbcontrollers.com/products/t-rudders-mk-v-rudder-pedals) because [I might like flight sim a little too much](https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/) and not a minute goes by while I'm sitting at my desk that my feet don't think they're resting on sostenuto and sustain pedals. Because there's also a keyboard sitting on my desk. 

So can I please just get something that actually turns them into that when I need them to?

I have, it has no documentation, and all the buttons are greyed out. Not a fan.

> "Have you tried [mJoy](http://www.otk.it/mjoy/)??"

I have. Have you? In 2024? Because if you have you wouldn't recommend it.

I like Ableton, but I dont want a specif-

Look, I own something like ten DAWs ([Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/), [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/), [Cubase](https://www.steinberg.net/cubase/), [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com), [Serrato](https://serato.com/), [Studio One](https://www.presonus.com/en/studio-one.html), [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), [Reason](https://www.reasonstudios.com/), [ReNoise](https://www.renoise.com/), [Waveform](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform-pro)) plus a bunch of esoteric or now-dead ones like [Flip](https://www.flipsampler.com/) or [SunVox](https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/) or [SonarX3](https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/cakewalk-sonar-x3-producer) or [ZRhythm](https://www.zrythm.org/en/index.html) (I know, the last one's free. I signed up to their nightly subscription because I think that effort _absolutely_ deserves funding) and "I stopped counting" however many standalone VSTi. You think I'm going to configure each of them separately? Because I'm definitely not.

> "Well what about [joy2midi](https://github.com/jessecrossen/hautmidi/tree/master/joy2midi)?"

A JACK-only linux suggestion? I like where your head's at, except I'm on Windows so that's not going to help us much here.

Actually, as it turns out... yeah? I can write a universal solution that'll work for anything that can deal with more than one MIDI device (which is everything) in like... 30 lines of code, if I'm willing to use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and LoopMIDI, [a utility that I already use](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html)?

Step 1: create a virtual MIDI device called "Rudder Sustain". Inspired name, I know: I'm a programmer, we're fantastic at naming things.

Step 2: write some code: `npm install node-hid easymidi`, and then something that's a near-trivial `pedals.js` file:

```
import HID from "node-hid";
import easymidi from "easymidi";
const map = (v, a, b, c, d) => (c + ((v - a) * (d - c)) / (b - a)) | 0;

// Get our virtual MIDI device
const out = new easymidi.Output("Rudder Sustain", process.platform !== "win32");

// Get our VKB-sim rudder
const v = `vendorId`;
const p = `productId`;
const rudder = HID.devices().find(({ [v]: a, [p]: b }) => a + b === 9276);
const device = await HID.HIDAsync.open(rudder[v], rudder[p]);

// And start mapping data!
const MIDPOINT = 1020;
let controller, value, max;
device.on("data", (data) => {
  // convert the controller bytes to a numeric value
  const v = data[14] * 255 + data[13];
  if (v !== MIDPOINT) {
    controller = v < MIDPOINT ? 66 : 64;
    max = v < MIDPOINT ? 0 : 2040;
    value = map(v, MIDPOINT, max, 0, 127);
    out.send("cc", { channel: 1, controller, value });
  }
});

console.log(`\nSustain mapper running. Press ctrl-c to exit.\n\n`);
```

Let me unpack that script a little:

1. First we get a reference to the virtual MIDI device that we created using loopMIDI by the venerable Tobias Erichsen.
1. Then we get a reference to the "Human Input Device" that my rudder pedals are registered as. USB is kind of bizarre in that every. single. USB. device. has to have its own vendor ID and product ID, and those **must** be registered with the USB consortium. I'm pretty sure that's a racket, but I can't prove it, so we'll leave it at that. VKB Sim's vendor id is 8989 and the product id is 287 so just because I want to write as little code as possible we add those and check if their sum is 9276.
1. Then we map the left and right pedals to [sostenuto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_pedals#Sostenuto_pedal) ("only hold the notes that are currently down") and [sustain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustain_pedal) ("don't dampen every note being played") respectively: the rudder pedals register values 0 through 1020 for the left pedal being down, and 1020 through 2040 for the right pedal being down, so we just map those values to the MIDI value range 0 through 127.
1. We then send the mapped value with either CC66 for sostenuto or CC64 for sustain, on MIDI channel 1. But only when the value isn't 1020, which is the value it'll be when I'm not pressing on either pedal. 

And... uh... that's it?  We can just run this with `node pedals` and done: as long as we enable the "Rudder Sustain" MIDI input  in whatever DAW or standalone instrument we're using, those flight sim pedals are now MIDI pedals. 

In less than 30 lines of code including vanity comments and console logs.

Programming is a superpower.
