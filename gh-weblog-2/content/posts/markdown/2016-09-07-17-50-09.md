Wow, that's an incendiary post title isn't it. Just because you use `document.write` doesn't say anything about your JavaScript skills, I mean it's just another function in the official ECMAScript spec, it's just an older one. Why the vitriol?

## Let's start at the start

The `document.write` function comes to us from the dark ages of the early JavaScript enabled web, and is really nothing like the JS you are likely to be familiar with.  It might be called `document.write` and invoked as if it's part of the document API, its true behaviour is much lower level: it is a proxy function in to the bytesteam pipe that defines what's even **in** in `document`. The `write` function doesn't let you "write some data into the document", it **is** the document, and that comes with some hilarious side effects.

## 1: `write` needs an open pipe

Say you have a web page, and that webpage has the following code:
```
<html>
  <head><title>whatever</title></head>
  <body>
    <script> document.write("<p>oh look a paragraph</p>"); </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
then you might expect this to write a paragraph at the time the script triggers. And you'd be right, but here is *why* you're right: the document pipe is still open, and the script element gets evaluated *while* the document is getting parsed. Want to see something hilarious:

```
<html>
  <head><title>whatever</title></head>
  <body>
    <script>
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        document.write("<p>oh look a paragraph</p>");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Want to guess what that does? Writes a paragraph into the document once it's finished loading? **no, not really**. Sure, if you put this in jsbin or the like that's what it looks like it does, but let's try this:

```
<html>
  <head><title>whatever</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Second test:</h1>
    <script>
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        document.write("<p>oh look a paragraph</p>");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
*Where did that `<h1>` go?*

Actually, the correct question is "where did **everything** go?" because your entire document got wiped. After all, `document.write` needs an open pipe, and there is no open pipe once all content has loaded. And so it makes one.

A new one.

*An empty one*

**`document` is now an empty, open data pipe**

So congratulations, you just wiped the page! And this is not a "quirk", this is literally what it's supposed to do, it's intended and explicit behaviour. If this was code you wrote on your own page, then lucky you, easy to fix (don't use `document.write`) but if this was a 3rd party library, good luck finding out which one is  responsible. And then replacing it with a modern library instead.

## 2.  `document.write` is insanely insecure.

If you know why `eval()` is bad, you should already see where this is going, but `document.write` is the most low-level version of eval you can come up with: it's *literally* the function for injecting data into a page, so let's do that:

```
<html>
  <head><title>whatever</title></head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://third.party.domain/perfectly-safe.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
and let's put a `document.write` in that "perfectly safe" js file!

```
document.write("<script> do.anything(); /* this runs as if it's part of your page now, not scoped to third.party.domain */ </script>");
```
Good times!

## 3.  `document.write` is synchronous

Because we can't defer `document.write` to after the document is done loading, all the `document.write` code *has* to run as part of the initial page load, and so anything it puts in your document increases time-to-load. If you are blessed enough to live in a part of the world where you've never noticed page load speed is
