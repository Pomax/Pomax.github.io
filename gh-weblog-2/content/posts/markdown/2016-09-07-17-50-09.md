Wow, that's an incendiary post title isn't it. Just because you use `document.write` doesn't say anything about your JavaScript skills, I mean it's just another function in the official ECMAScript spec, it's just an older one. Why the vitriol?

## Let's start at the start

The `document.write` function comes to us from the dark ages of the early JavaScript enabled web, and is really nothing like the JS you are likely to be familiar with.  It might be called `document.write` and invoked as if it's part of the document API, its true behaviour is much lower level: it is a proxy function in to the bytesteam pipe that defines what's even **in** in `document`. The `write` function doesn't let you "write some data into the document", it **is** the document, and that comes with some hilarious side effects.

## 1: `write` needs an open pipe

Say you have a web page, and that webpage has the following code:
```
<html>
  <head><title>whatever</title></head>
  <body>
    <script> document.write("<p>oh look a paragraph</p>"); </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
then you might expect this to write a paragraph at the time the script triggers. And you'd be right, but here is *why* you're right: the document pipe is still open, and the script element gets evaluated *while* the document is getting parsed. Want to see something hilarious:

```
<html>
  <head><title>whatever</title></head>
  <body>
    <script>
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        document.write("<p>oh look a paragraph</p>");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Want to guess what that does? Writes a paragraph into the document once it's finished loading? **no, not really**. Sure, if you put this in jsbin or the like that's what it looks like it does, but let's try this:

```
<html>
  <head><title>whatever</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Second test:</h1>
    <script>
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        document.write("<p>oh look a paragraph</p>");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
*Where did that `<h1>` go?*

Actually, the correct question is "where did **everything** go?" because your entire document got wiped. After all, `document.write` needs an open pipe, and there is no open pipe once all content has loaded. And so it makes one.

A new one.

*An empty one*

**`document` is now an empty, open data pipe**

So congratulations, you just wiped the page! And this is not a "quirk", this is literally what it's supposed to do, it's intended and explicit behaviour. If this was code you wrote on your own page, then lucky you, easy to fix (don't use `document.write`) but if this was a 3rd party library, good luck finding out which one is  responsible. And then replacing it with a modern library instead.

## 2.  `document.write` is insanely insecure.

If you know why `eval()` is bad, you should already see where this is going, but `document.write` is the most low-level version of eval you can come up with: it's *literally* the function for injecting data into a page, so let's do that:

```
<html>
  <head><title>whatever</title></head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://third.party.domain/perfectly-safe.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
and let's put a `document.write` in that "perfectly safe" js file!

```
document.write("<script> do.anything(); /* this runs as if it's part of your page now, not scoped to third.party.domain */ </script>");
```
Good times!

## 3.  `document.write` is synchronous

Because we can't defer `document.write` to after the document is done loading, all the `document.write` code *has* to run as part of the initial page load, and so anything it puts in your document increases time-to-load. If you are blessed enough to live in a part of the world where you've never noticed page load speed, good for you! But a *lot* of people are still on slow connections, and any page blocking before the browser can show an initial view (which it only does once it reaches the `</body>` tag) is extremely obvious.

## Okay, fine, but say I know all these things, why do I suck at JavaScript if I use it? I know what I'm doing!

I'm going to  argue that you don't. Modern JS has many constructions that are non-destructive, secure, and non-blocking. Why not use those instead?

### adding content to the document

The proper way to add content to your document, using modern, non-destructive code, is by using the DOM manipulation API. In vanilla JS, things like this:

```
<html>
  <head><title>whatever</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Second test:</h1>
    <script>
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        var body = document.body.
        var p = document.createElement("p");
        p.textContent = "wow, a new paragraph!";
        body.appendChild(p);
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
Is that cumbersome? Sure is, so if you have to manipulate the DOM, use something like jQuery or Zepto or the like instead, because they give you far easier APIs, while making sure to fall through to proper DOM manipulation instead of `document.write`:

```
<html>
  <head><title>whatever</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Second test:</h1>
    <script>
      $(function() {
        $(document.body).append($("<p>Wow, a new paragraph!</p>");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Done.  And it runs asynchronous, too, so your page isn't blocked from loading.

### I use `document.write` to see debug information!

Okay... wait, what? Why are you doing that? It's 2016, but even if this was 2010: use the `console` API, because that's what it for.

You open your browser's dev tools view, and you use `console.log(...)` to write data to the dev tools console. In fact, unlike `document.write` which can only write strings (obviously), `console.log` can write *everything*. Strings, arrays, full objects, it makes all those things accessible in the console in an explorable way. In fact, it even has `console.warn()` and `console.error()`, so you can be specific about what your debug is for (just "see the data" vs "strong signal that something's wrong").

### I use it for-

I kind of stopped caring: whatever you're doing, there is a modern JS way to do that without using **a bare-bones byte injection function hooked into the normally inaccessible document byte map**. 

# Do you *really* suck at JavaScript? Probably not.

So back to the original proposition. Do you suck at JavaScript? Well, sort of. You're using a function you shouldn't ever have been taught to use. That happens. We all started at a position of "knowing nothing about JavaScript", so not knowing how bad `document.write` is, is kind of a given. However, now you know, and now you need to go and find all those places where you use it.

So only to all of you who don't stop using `document.write`: you absolutely suck at JavaScript, and the world is worse off because of you. Shape up, and help everyone learn better JS by writing better JS. You have the skills and the power, exercise them.
