# About Me

Most people will know me from nihongoresources, but a small number of people know me as Michiel Kamermans, a guy who for the longest time was a student of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam, and only recently bothered to actually graduate and 'move on' as it were. Personally I would have prefered to take up a new bachlor/masters in biology, but money doesn't quite permit me to. No old money in my family...

For those interested in such manners, I have prepared a CV which can be accessed by hitting the CV subsection.
