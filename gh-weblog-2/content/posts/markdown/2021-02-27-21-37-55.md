Yours and everyone else's: there are two things you *need* to do.

1. Reset your nvram by restarting macos and holding `Command+Option+P+R`: hold all four keys down at the same time while your mac boots, and you'll know it worked when you hear the mac chime. It'll autoreboot after resetting the nvram but just keep those keys pressed until you hear the chime a second time, just for good measure.

2. Disable macos' drive standby, because your SSD is almost certainly incompatible with the apple hardware instructions. Open a terminal and run:

```
$ sudo pmset -a standby 0 
```

You're done, your new (presumably much bigger) NVMe SSD will work just fine now,  and your mac will no longer crash at random
