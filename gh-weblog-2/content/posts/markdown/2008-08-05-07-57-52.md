# Pomax and Baguette...

I like to bake bread. I particularly pride myself on my French bread, which without patting myself on my shoulder is better than most Parisian boulangeries. I should know, because our last Paris trip was, in part, one to find a boulangerie that made baguette that surpassed mine. You would imagine that as a home baker this would not be too hard, but none of the "well ranked" boulangeries got even close. <a href="http://www.poilane.fr/" target="_blank">PoilÃ¢ne</a> had decently tasty baguette, but still not as good. This was very weird. Also, disappointing. Lastly, it means I will simply keep making French bread.
