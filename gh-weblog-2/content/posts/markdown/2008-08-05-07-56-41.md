# I love cooking.

I'm what you might call a home chef. I don't cook every day since I have no family to cook for, so I really only get into my element when I either feel like being exuberant or we have guests over in which case the cooking's on. I have a ridiculous cookbook collection (more cook books than study books, and I studied at university for 8 years >.>). I particularly love coming up with dessert ideas that will kill people. Nothing fragmentation grenade-y, just things like a chocolate mousse base with white chocolate imitations of artichoke leaves with dark chocolate tips, arranged to look like an artichoke, with an orange coulis and some drip-streams of Cointreaux caramel, Jackson Pollocked over the plate... You know, desserts that kill you.
