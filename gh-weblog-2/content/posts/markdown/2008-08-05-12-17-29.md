# Dreamhost does not do fopen_url_wrapper=true

Like the title says, dreamhost does not allow fopen_url_wrapper=true by default. In fact, the wiki rather moronically states that "It's a bad idea! You should never want to do this! Hurr hurr hurr!"

Okay so maybe I made those lines up, but their <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Allow_url_fopen" target="_blank">wiki page</a> on the issue is written by someone who clearly never imagined someone would want to use, say, GD to open a remote image, edit it, and then output it to a website.

That would be something that I do, for instance, by getting my latest Flickr image and cropping it to suit the website's size... Obviously I went with the "fsck you, dreamhost, just because your article writer thought it was a bad idea doesn't mean it is." and ran through the procedure to override the php.ini with a local php.ini file.
