I'm working on a fun little side project implementing an autopilot in JavaScript to "drive" planes in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, and one of the things it needs is an altitude computer/terrain follow system. And in order to make that reasonably accurate, I figured I'd download the entire planet's elevation data in the form of the [ALOS Wolrd 3D (30m)](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/aw3d30/aw3d30_e.htm) dataset. This is 450GB of DSM, HLG, and mask data, and takes the form of [GeoTiff](http://geotiff.maptools.org/spec/geotiff2.html) files.
